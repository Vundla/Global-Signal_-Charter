- **Recovery KPIs**: MTTR, error budgets, resilience reserve usage
- **Quarterly "Crash It If You Can" Rituals**: Scheduled chaos tests with measured KPIs
- **Blameless Postmortems**: Incidents archived as Codex verses + technical logs

### 4. Unified Alerting & Escalation ✅

- **On-Call Rotation**: Day, night, weekend coverage mapped
- **Escalation Matrix**: Severity × time × channel decision table
- **GitHub Issue Auto-Creation**: Alerts spawn issues linked to Grafana panels
- **Postmortem Automation**: GitHub Actions auto-generate templates
- **Alert Closure**: Issues auto-close when anomalies resolve

### 5. Presentation & Slide Deck ✅
- **10-Slide Deck**: Covenant workflow from alerts → closure → archival
- **Speaker Notes**: Narrative for each slide
- **Executive Summary**: One-pager for funders
- **Workflow Diagram**: Visual blueprint of escalation channels

### 6. Codex Verses Integrated ✅
- **10 Unique Verses**: Covering all phases, sectors, and observability
- **README Integration**: Verses inscribed alongside technical documentation
- **Frontend Tabs**: Each sector card displays relevant verse
- **Phase 3 Dashboard**: Observability, security, chaos sections with verses
- **Reusable Component**: CodexVerse.svelte for flexible verse display
- **Library**: codex.ts with type-safe verse definitions and helpers

## Codex Verses Inscribed

### Phase 1: Foundation
```
Each nation contributes a stream,
0.01 of its wealth into the river.
The river flows first to the poor,
towers rise, villages connect, children learn.

Profit returns as covenant,
sustaining nations, feeding budgets,
yet the first fruits are always for the struggling.

Offline yet sovereign,
cached light flows into communities,
resilience becomes law,
unity becomes inheritance.
```

### Phase 2: Economic Orchestration
```
Agriculture feeds, minerals sustain,
energy empowers, technology connects.
Yet without education, minds remain bound,
without health, bodies cannot rise.

The covenant must teach and heal,
so nations may grow in fullness.
Six sectors woven into one ledger,
27 projects flowing as one stream.

Crash it if you can—
resilience becomes law,
unity becomes inheritance.
```

### Phase 3: Observability & Guardianship
```
Alerts rise, escalation speaks,
issues opened, postmortems born.
Closure cleanses, Codex archives,
six sectors guarded, covenant whole.

Dashboards inscribe the covenant,
anomalies flagged by watchers.
Education awakens, health sustains,
resilience becomes law,
unity becomes inheritance.
```
